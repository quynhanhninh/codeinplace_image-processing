# Image Processing - Assignment 3 at Code in Place (Stanford University)
## Description
In Code in Place 2021, I completed three small Python programs that processed and edited images for Assignment 3 in the course. These short Python programs use SimpleImage library built and provided by Stanford University to:
- Apply the Code in Place filter to an image by changing the RGB color values of each pixel in that image (see "codeinplace_filter.py").
- Detect the "forest fire" in an image: finding all of the “sufficiently red” pixels and highlighting those pixel by making them entirely red while every other pixel is turned to their greyscale equivalent (see "forest_fire.py").
- Return an output image that is twice the height of the original with the top half identical to the original image and the bottom half a reflection of the top half (see "reflection.py").

## Credits
SimpleImage is a library, using Pillow library that extends Python’s functionality in terms of digital image processing. It was written by Nicholas Bowman, Sonja Johnson-Yu, Kylie Jue for CS106AP 2019 in Stanford University.

I would like to send the greatest acknowledgement to the course instructors of Code in Place 2021 who provided us with SimpleImage library, this cool assignment on Image Processing, and all the nice images as included in this repository.
